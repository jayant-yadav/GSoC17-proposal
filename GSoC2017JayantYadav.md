**Project: **AngularJS Web App Enhancements

**Questions:-**

1. Project Idea:

	This GSoC project aims to improve UI of the AngularJs Web App, which is the standard application on the Mifos X distribution. Improving the interface is essential so that it gives an enhanced user experience and boosts their productivity. The more intuitive is the design, the easier it is for the user to understand how the application works. This will help the organization to reach more people and deliver financial services more effectively and efficiently. 

2. Briefly cover what you expect to complete in this project and when:

* Community bonding period

    * Get familiar with code base. Specially the part which requires to be understood for making of web app.

    * Discuss the possible app designs by making wireframes.

	Milestone 1: Finalize the designs before coding starts.

* 3-4 weeks:

    * Redesign the client, group, and center records

    * Redesign the loan and summary savings pages

    * Implement Wizard UI product and account creation

    * Implement UI for workflows & data table entity checks

	Milestone 2: Complete the above mentioned UIs

* 3-4 weeks:

    * Improve the collection sheet UI

    * Extend the notifications framework

    * Improve interface for role-based dashboards.

    * Performance improvements by introducing on demand loading

	Milestone 3: Complete the above mentioned UIs

	This plan can go as expected or we can re-distribute the task as required.   

3. Why are you the right person for this project?

	

	I have experience in working at front-end and know JavaScript, **AngularJS**, JQuery, **Bootstrap**, Foundation5, HTML5 , PHP, codeigniter and CSS3.

I was also selected in Mozilla Winter of Security 2016 (**MWoS**) and currently making a WebUI for their Mig (Mozilla Investigator) project. Hence, I have experience in working with large code bases and never hesitate to ask questions. Besides, I have done **Internships** in two different companies, full-stack development ( mostly front-end) job and made website in college level projects.   

	

This project is special to me since I always wanted to help people on the ground level. By this I mean, to do something for the those who are not privileged to take advantage of today’s technology. Thus, I believe in  Mifos Initiative’s  tagline "End Poverty One Line of Code at a Time".
